      "content": "Weni's purpose and mission involve unlocking human potential by transforming communication through smart, open and accessible technology. This means, above all, providing a safe environment for the expression and development of the full personal potential of each person who is part of Weni. We transform communication as we develop tools that are increasingly capable of meeting the needs of our customers with quality. And our focus is to work more and more in this process so that these technologies are robust, reliable, open and accessible.<br /><br />For our objectives to be achieved, it is also important that our employees and customers are aligned with our values , culture and principles. This applies to the development and research of artificial intelligence and product development, as well as all our services offered, to unleash human potential and impact our partners' experience more and more positively every day.<br /><br />We have a team of excellence and we encourage all Weniers to see this. Putting into practice and chasing goals - ours, together, and the personal ones of each one.<br />We believe in and value our indicators as they guide our actions. If the Weniers come in thinking about learning and developing more, that is the focus, because we know that great results generate great learning.<br /><br />We have a real interest in the client's success, because our solutions are not thought of as a closed box and he will have to enter it. We always listen to our customers' problem, context and opportunity. Thus, dreaming together with them and creating possibilities of impact with our technology.<br /><br />We understand, believe and preach our technology and who we are. Always thinking and acting to release human potential from our technology. For this, working together goes beyond dialogue; Collaboration is the action of creating, developing and listening to what others have to say about your work and how you can improve.<br /><br />We value diversity and plurality in our team, we do our best to put everyone at ease and we are proud of that. Do you know why? Because we understand that people with different backgrounds and different experiences, who have visions that complement each other, bring a broader picture and, consequently, take us further. This has everything to do with empathy. Although we have a common goal, we are different and we have our skills and much to add.<br /><br />The world is changing right now, so we need to keep up with these transformations. We know that our team is amazing and we are passionate about learning, sharing ideas and updates, so we never stop in the now and always seek new knowledge and positive experiences.<br /><br />This is the foundation of all our values: we are passionate about results, we work together to offer a service of excellence and quality because the customer is the reason. We are one, we are different and we are non-conformists, that is why we work so that our products have a social impact and bring value.<br /><br />In our culture code our values are essential and the production of our technology for society it's not just about developing a product that's smart, open, and accessible; but that produces value for society and social impact. Since the birth of Weni, its core business has directly involved generating impacts on millions of people - Several projects developed have impacted people who had access to our technology, releasing human potential. When we talk about a positive impact, it is not only in the external sphere, but also in the day to day work.<br /><br />Ethics, in many aspects, refers to different norms or rules that we need to follow in order to achieve a good life in society - we treat as normative ethics. In addition, it is important to emphasize that for human potential to be released to its maximum, it is necessary to guarantee conditions for this. Therefore, when we deal with the principles and conducts on which our entire existence and development are based, we are not only talking about the norms and values we follow, but about the virtues we encourage so that this potential can flourish.<br /><br />According to Aristotelian conception of ethics, which involves the pursuit of happiness. We encourage an environment that is based on our employees and customers seeking to:<br /> <ul style=\"margin-bottom: 0\"> <li> Respect the individuality of people and themselves </li> <li> I care about the development of others </li> <li> I am kind to my co-workers and customers; </li> <li> Feed on different opinions to make decisions; </li> <li> Have the courage not to remain silent in the face of human rights violations; </li> <li> To have the courage to face your prejudices; </li> <li> I use Weni technologies in favor of my work; </li> <li> I use technology sparingly; </li> <li> I communicate with the client in a didactic and proactive way.; </li> <li> I have the courage to do what has never been done; </li> <li> Seek to develop and be a reference in what you do; </li> </ul><br /><br /> <b>1. PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT</b><br /><br /> When we talk about developing a product, from its conception, development to delivery, these are all important points for us. Our main mission with product development is to achieve the company's Mission and Vision, giving more and more autonomy to its users.<br /><br />It is very important to clarify that we do not use technology for technology's sake - it is a tool that helps us express our culture to generate value and social impact.<br /><br /> Our responsibility is to ensure that this product fulfills its role of helping organizations to unleash human potential, in an easy and accessible way.<br /><br /> It is through the product that Weni achieves its mission. It is the product that makes Weni viable, without a product we have no Weni.. without Weni there is no product.<br /><br /> Our products must:<br /> <ul style=\"margin- bottom: 0\"> <li>Always be aligned with our mission and values;</li> <li>Seek excellence and quality;</li> <li>Be within our ethical principles;</li> <li >Helping organizations to release human potential in an easy and accessible way;</li> <li>Helping organizations to release human potential by generating value and positive impact.</li> </ul> <br /><br /> 2. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE DEVELOPMENT<br /><br /> Artificial intelligence is the how, not the reason, for us to achieve Weni's goal of unlocking human potential. We believe that without high technology, without the use of artificial intelligence, we will not be able to reach our goal, but for that the development, research and use of AI's must also be aligned with our values.<br /><br /> Weni wants to achieve and impact thousands of organizations and hundreds of millions of users with the development and use of artificial intelligence. For this, our main concern and responsibility when we talk about the implementation of artificial intelligence models is that they are accessible (cost and use), useful and consistent with Weni's principles and values.<br /><br /> If we had the best model and it wasn't easy to use and its cost is prohibitive, we're not hitting the target. If we have an excellent, easy-to-use, and financially accessible model but it does not have much applicability, it is not useful, we have not reached the objective. If we have everything but AI doesn't meet Weni's values we are not achieving the goal.<br /><br /> From the use and application of principles in artificial intelligence development - our models and AI development must:<br /> <ul style=\"margin-bottom: 0\"> <li>Always be aligned with our mission and values; </li><li> Seek excellence and quality; </li><li> Be within our ethical principles; </li><li> Help organizations unlock human potential in an easy and accessible way; </li><li> Helping organizations release human potential by generating value and positive impact; </li><li> Be open and transparent; </li><li>Be fair, inclusive and diverse; </li><li> Be reproducible; </li><li> Positively impact people </li> </ul> <br /><br /> 3. WENI CODE OF CONDUCT<br /> <ul style=\"margin-bottom : 0\"> <li> Unleash human potential with transparent, honest, loyal and respectful conduct.</li> <li> Offer people dignity, freedom and privacy</li> <li> We do not tolerate any kind of harassment harassment, discrimination and prejudice</li> <li> We protect and respect the data of our employees and customers</li> <li> We develop products and services that have a positive impact and generate value for people and organizations</li> </ ul>"
